<p>Bookmarks are vital for regular Internet users. Many of us build a massive collection of favorite Internet addresses over the years, as we keep finding useful pages to return to. When reading a book, most of us are unable to remember where we left off each time we pick it up. So imagine the frustration and the challenge in finding your favorite pages without the help of bookmarks! Even though they are not as visible as, for instance, backgrounds, images, themes, or gadgets, bookmarks build perhaps the most accurate digital replica of our personalities.</p>
<p>So you have an impressive amount of bookmarks saved in your browser, neatly structured in folders, that you use daily. They work just great, and help you a lot in your work, study, or fun.</p>
<p>But what if you want to, or need to use them in another browser, or on another computer? Or on a tablet, laptop, or smartphone, so that you are not bound to a single home computer? Wouldn't it be nice to be able to turn your bookmarks into portable bookmarks, or cross-web, cross-device entities? However, most browsers save bookmarks in formats that are not compatible with other browsers. For instance, <a href="http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie" target="_blank">Internet Explorer</a> saves pages as URL files and <a href="http://www.mozilla.org/firefox/" target="_blank">Mozilla Firefox</a> saves them as SQLite files.</p>

It has the "elixir" that reincarnates any Internet address (link, URL, bookmark, favorite) to a very small HTML file that you can open in any browser, on any device, with any operating system!
