                            <p>ColorVeil adds a customizable color filter over your Desktop, Internet browser, video player, document, email, or program. You can work, play, read, write, or browse as usual. </p>

                            <p>ColorVeil can help people with Dyslexia / Meares Irlen's Syndrome. It applies a coloured tint across the screen, color that can match the prescription from the optometrist.</p>

                            <p>ColorVeil can reduce screen brightness, even below its lowest available setting. This helps you reduce eye strain, especially at night, and may help save battery on notebooks and tablets.</p>

                            <p>ColorVeil lets you easily customize the filter color and opacity. For example, choose Orange to block out the blue light responsible for sleep deprivation.</p>

                            <p>ColorVeil can go stealth and hide its turn off switch, helping you play pranks on your friends or family. It can also spice up screencasts or presentations, by adding color to the video output.</p>

                <p>"As Head of Learning support we have been looking for the last few years to support children and young people with Dyslexia / Meares Irlen syndrome by way of coloured overlays, but have never been able to find a solution that works on computers. ColorVeil gives us the perfect solution, allowing full customisation by way of overlay to match the colours stated by the optometrist, removing a significant barrier to that young person's learning."</p>
