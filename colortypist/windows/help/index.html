            With Colortypist you can type in a color by its name or code, and see it fill your entire screen,
            in real-time, while you type. You can easily set any color you like as your Desktop Wallpaper, and
            get a more modern looking Desktop and a faster PC. You can also save any color to a tiny and fully
            portable HTML file, that can be opened by any browser, PC, tablet or smartphone.
        </p>
        <p>
            Colortypist can also copy colors for reuse in other applications, and generate sample images of any
            size filled with the color of your choice. The Random menu lets you easily create beautiful and rare
            random colors, and the View menu helps you easily convert between HTML color codes, RGB triplets, or
            color names.
        </p>
        <p>Colortypist has a clean and easy to use interface, and requires no installation: simply download and run.</p>

        <p>
            Last but not least, Colortypist may help you have fun playing with colors, discovering and naming new
            colors, and even checking the color of your birthday (#800522 for May 22, 1980).
