        <p>InjuredPixels allows you to easily check for defective (hot, dead or stuck) pixels on LCD monitors.</p>
        <p>
          InjuredPixels can be used to test a new LCD monitor before purchasing, or an already purchased monitor during
          the warranty period (as you may get a replacement according to the manufacturer's dead pixel policy).
          InjuredPixels fills the entire screen with a primary or custom color, allowing you to inspect the screen for
          pixels that do not match the selected color.
        </p>
        <p>
          The program is easy to use: click or use the arrow keys to cycle through colors or right-click to get the menu
          with the main commands. InjuredPixels can be run directly without having to install it on your computer: just
          download the portable version and run.

        <p>The main menu contains items that perform the main actions of InjuredPixels.</p>
        <p>
          To open the main menu, click the right mouse button anywhere on the screen, or press the Esc or the Menu key on your keyboard. The main menu is
          automatically opened when the program starts.

        <p>To close the main menu without selecting any item, click the left mouse button anywhere on the screen, or press Esc on your keyboard.</p>

        <h4 class="help-subsection-heading">Black</h4>
        <p>

          two sub-pixels always on or always off) are usually best seen against a dark or black background.
        </p>

        <h4 class="help-subsection-heading">White</h4>
        <p>
          Click this menu item to change the screen color to White (#FFFFFF). Dead pixels (defective pixels that remain unlit) are usually best seen against a white
          background.

        <h4 class="help-subsection-heading">Red</h4>
        <p>Click this menu item to change the screen color to Red (#FF0000). Red is one of three sub-pixels which produce the visible color of the pixel by their relative

        <p>
          Click this menu item to change the screen color to Green (#00FF00). Green is one of three sub-pixels which produce the visible color of the pixel by their

          Technical note: InjuredPixels uses the primary Green color of a RGB display (#00FF00), that corresponds to the Lime Web Color and it is different from the
          Green color defined in HTML specifications.
        </p>

        <h4 class="help-subsection-heading">Show Mouse Cursor</h4>
        <p>Check this menu item to show the mouse cursor. To make it easier to spot defective pixels on the screen, the mouse cursor is hidden when InjuredPixels starts.</p>
        <p>Please note that if you have selected to hide the mouse cursor and open the pop-up menu or switch to other programs, the mouse cursor will become visible.</p>
