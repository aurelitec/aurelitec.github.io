        <p>
            Use InjuredPixels to screen test a smartphone or tablet in the store, before buying, or during the warranty period, as you may get a replacement
            according to the manufacturer's dead pixel policy. InjuredPixels fills the entire screen with a primary or custom color, helping you to easily spot
            pixels that do not match the selected color.
        </p>
        <p>The app is very easy to use:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>tap the color buttons or use the volume keys to cycle through colors</li>
            <li>double tap anywhere to hide the buttons and check every inch for defects</li>
            <li>double tap again to show the buttons</li>
            <li>swipe down from the top of the screen and tap Back or Home to exit the app</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            Note: When going full (empty) screen, touching, tapping or swiping does nothing, giving you the freedom to clean or gently rub any area while
            testing.
        </p>
        <p>InjuredPixels is completely free, doesn't show ads, and requires no Internet and no extra permissions whatsoever.</p>
