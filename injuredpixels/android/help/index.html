                Use InjuredPixels to screen test a smartphone or tablet in the store, before buying, or during the warranty
                period, as you may get a replacement according to the manufacturer's dead pixel policy. InjuredPixels fills
                the entire screen with a primary or custom color, helping you to easily spot pixels that do not match the
                selected color.
            </p>
            <p>The app is very easy to use:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>tap the color buttons or use the volume keys to cycle through colors</li>
                <li>double tap anywhere to hide the buttons and check every inch for defects</li>
                <li>double tap again to show the buttons</li>
                <li>swipe down from the top of the screen and tap Back or Home to exit the app</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Note: When going full (empty) screen, touching, tapping or swiping does nothing, giving you the freedom to
                clean or gently rub any area while testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                InjuredPixels is completely free, doesn't show ads, and requires no Internet and no extra permissions
                whatsoever.
            </p>
