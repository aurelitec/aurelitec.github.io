"As Head of Learning support we have been looking for the last few years to support children and young people with Dyslexia / Meares Irlen syndrome by way of coloured overlays, but have never been able to find a solution that works on computers. ColorVeil gives us the perfect solution, allowing full customisation by way of overlay to match the colours stated by the optometrist, removing a significant barrier to that young person's learning."
