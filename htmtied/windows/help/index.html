           HTMtied instantly converts any Internet address (link, URL, bookmark, favorite) to a very small HTML file
           that when opened in any browser, it will automatically load that address. Use it when you want to save an
           Internet address for future use on your computer, tablet, smartphone, web storage, Windows, Mac, Android,
           iOS, etc.
         </p>
         <p>
           Using HTMtied is easy as 1, 2, 3. Step 1: Copy the Internet address from your browser's address bar or from
           any link to the Clipboard. Step 2: Run HTMtied (from the Desktop, Start Menu, or better yet, from a shortcut
           key you define). HTMtied will automatically convert that address to a linking HTML file and copy the file to
           the Clipboard. Step 3: Simply paste the file anywhere you want.
         </p>
         <p>
           Starting with Version 2.0, HTMtied supports conversion of links en masse: copy any number of Internet
           addresses on separate lines to the Clipboard or drag and drop any number of URL files over HTMtied, and
           linking HTML files will be created for each address. There is also the new Direct Mode, a special HTMtied
           shortcut that, when clicked, it will automatically save all the link HTML files to a directory of your
           choosing (Documents, Dropbox, etc.).
         </p>
         <p>
           Windows and Internet Explorer can save Internet addresses to URL files. However, URL files are not a standard
           and cannot be used across different platforms. Linking HTML files created by HTMtied work anywhere. And yes,
           HTMtied can convert URL files to linking HTML files: simply copy the URL files on the Clipboard and run
           HTMtied. Or drag and drop the URL files over the HTMtied icon.
         </p>
         <p>
           HTMtied is so easy to use that it doesn't even need a user interface: if everything goes well, the famous
           "Tada" sound is played. On failure, an error sound is played. HTMtied can also be downloaded and run
           directly, without installation.
