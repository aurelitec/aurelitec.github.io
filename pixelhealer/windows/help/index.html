        <p>
            PixelHealer can help you try to fix dead pixels by yourself, before running back to the store! You can use it to fix dead, stuck or hot pixels on
            LCD or TFT screens, on desktop monitors, laptops or tablets.
        </p>
        <p>
            First of all, use our own free <a href="{{ site.custom.url }}/injuredpixels/windows/" target="_blank">InjuredPixels</a> portable app to check your
            screen or tablet for dead, stuck or hot pixels. Then, download and run PixelHealer without installation, cover the dead pixel with the colored
            repair window, and click Start Flashing. PixelHealer uses the already tested concept that flashing RGB colors over a dead or stuck pixel will revive
            it. So let the repair window run for a while, then check to see if the dead pixel has been fixed or revived. And repeat the process if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            PixelHealer has an intuitive interface and it is very easy to use. Use the mouse or your finger to move or resize the repair window. Open the
            intuitive Settings window to change the flashing colors, the flashing interval, or to automatically close the app after a certain period of time.
        </p>

        <h2 class="aur-content-heading">Quick Start</h2>
        <p>
            To start and use PixelHealer, no installation is required: simply click the "Download And Run" button from the
            <a href="{{ site.custom.url}}/pixelhealer/windows/download/">PixelHealer download page</a>, save the Windows executable program file to a location
            on your computer and then open or run the file.
        </p>
        <p>
            PixelHealer will open two windows: the repair window (a small red window), and a larger Settings window, with various settings and information. Use
            the mouse or your finger to move the red window over the dead pixel, and click the Start Flashing button from the Settings window. PixelHealer uses
            the already tested concept that flashing RGB colors over a dead or stuck pixel will revive it. So let the repair window run for a while, then check
            to see if the dead pixel has been fixed or revived. Repeat the process if necessary.

        <h2 class="aur-content-heading">The Menu</h2>
        <p>The intuitive PixelHealer Settings window allows you to control the dead pixel repair process.</p>
        <p>
          The Settings window is automatically opened when the program starts. To close it, click the <i>Close Settings</i> button. To reopen it, right-click
          the flashing repair window, press <i>Escape</i> while the repair window is focused, or click the PixelHealer icon from the Windows taskbar
          notification area.
        </p>

        <h3 class="aur-content-subsubheading">Start Flashing/Stop Flashing</h3>

          Click the <i>Start Flashing</i> button to start the dead pixel repair process. The button's text will change to <i>Stop Flashing</i>, and you can use
          it to stop (pause) flashing at any time.

        <h3 class="aur-content-subsubheading">Flashing Interval</h3>
        <p>
          Use the <i>Flashing Interval</i> track bar to change the flashing speed. A 10 millisecond interval between color changes is the default setting. Feel
          free to experiment with various speeds and see which one brings you the best results.
        </p>

        <h3 class="aur-content-subsubheading">Flashing Window Position and Size</h3>

          common sizes, such as 1x1, 5x5, 10x10, and up to 500x500.

        <p>
            Check this option to ensure that the PixelHealer repair window remains on top of all other windows. This is required for the repair process to take
            place.

          can also add a custom color, and change its value by right-clicking on the <i>Custom</i> check box. By default, all the standard RGB colors are
          selected.
