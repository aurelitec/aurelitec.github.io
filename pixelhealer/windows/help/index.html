        <p>
            PixelHealer can help you try to fix dead pixels by yourself, before running back to the store! You can
            use it to fix dead, stuck or hot pixels on LCD or TFT screens, on desktop monitors, laptops or tablets.
        </p>
        <p>
            First of all, use our own free <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/injuredpixels/windows/" target="_blank">InjuredPixels</a> portable app
            to check your screen or tablet for dead, stuck or hot pixels. Then, download and run PixelHealer without
            installation, cover the dead pixel with the colored repair window, and click Start Flashing. PixelHealer
            uses the already tested concept that flashing RGB colors over a dead or stuck pixel will revive it. So
            let the repair window run for a while, then check to see if the dead pixel has been fixed or revived.
            And repeat the process if necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            PixelHealer has an intuitive interface and it is very easy to use. Use the mouse or your finger to move
            or resize the repair window. Open the intuitive Settings window to change the flashing colors, the
            flashing interval, or to automatically close the app after a certain period of time.

            To start and use PixelHealer, no installation is required: simply click the "Download And Run" button
            from the <a href="{{ site.github.url }}/pixelhealer/windows/download/">PixelHealer download page</a>, save the Windows
            executable program file to a location on your computer and then open or run the file.
        </p>
        <p>
            PixelHealer will open two windows: the repair window (a small red window), and a larger Settings window,
            with various settings and information. Use the mouse or your finger to move the red window over the dead
            pixel, and click the Start Flashing button from the Settings window. PixelHealer uses the already tested
            concept that flashing RGB colors over a dead or stuck pixel will revive it. So let the repair window run
            for a while, then check to see if the dead pixel has been fixed or revived. Repeat the process if necessary.
