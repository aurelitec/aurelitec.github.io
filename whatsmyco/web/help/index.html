            Type your name and get your matching color! Works for any name, title, quote, sentence, or even files. A fun and personal way to discover and share
            beautiful colors, or inspiration for any task that requires color. And a creative way to breath new life into your Internet persona and online
            presence. Turn words you love into colors you love, copy and reuse their code, or save color swatches that can be used as profile photos, or as
            beautiful modern wallpapers. WhatsMyCo works in any modern browser, and on any device: PCs, notebooks, tablets, or smartphones. No install and no
            plugins required.
