        <p>
            Thumbico displays the thumbnail or icon of any file, image, document, video or program from your Desktop or computer. But unlike Windows, which
            shows you small, standard sized images, Thumbico gives you the large, any size "uncensored" version. Thumbico offers image saving and copying, a
            Glass Mode for screenshot or screencast purposes, custom or standard sizes, and drag and drop support.
        </p>
        <p>
            Software developers can find Thumbico useful for testing how their program icon looks like at different sizes (Taskbar size, Start Menu size,
            Desktop size) and how the icon transparency blends with different backgrounds.
