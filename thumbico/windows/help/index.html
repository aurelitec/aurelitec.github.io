            Thumbico displays the thumbnail or icon of any file, image, document, video or program from your
            Desktop or computer. But unlike Windows, which shows you small, standard sized images, Thumbico
            gives you the large, any size "uncensored" version. Thumbico offers image saving and copying, a
            Glass Mode for screenshot or screencast purposes, custom or standard sizes, and drag and drop support.
        </p>
        <p>
            Software developers can find Thumbico useful for testing how their program icon looks like at different
            sizes (Taskbar size, Start Menu size, Desktop size) and how the icon transparency blends with different
            backgrounds.
